	abstract = {Background
We tested the hypothesis that states with higher rates of cancers associated with human papillomavirus ({HPV}) would have lower {HPV} vaccine coverage.

Methods
We gathered state-level data on {HPV}-related cancer rates and {HPV} vaccine initiation coverage for girls and boys, separately, and {HPV} vaccine follow-through (i.e., receipt of 3 doses among those initiating the series) for girls only. In addition, we gathered state-level data on demographic composition and contact with the healthcare system. We calculated Pearson correlations for these ecological relationships.

Results
{HPV} vaccine initiation among girls was lower in states with higher levels of cervical cancer incidence and mortality (r=−.29 and −.46, respectively). In addition, vaccine follow-through among girls was lower in states with higher levels of cervical cancer mortality (r=−.30). Other cancer rates were associated with {HPV} vaccine initiation and follow-through among girls, but not among boys. {HPV} vaccine initiation among girls was lower in states with higher proportions of non-Hispanic black residents and lower proportions of higher income residents. {HPV} vaccine follow-through was higher in states with greater levels of adolescents' contact with the healthcare system.

Conclusions
{HPV} vaccine coverage for girls was lower in states with higher {HPV}-related cancer rates. Public health efforts should concentrate on geographic areas with higher cancer rates. Strengthening adolescent preventive healthcare use may be particularly important to increase vaccine follow-through. Cost-effectiveness analyses may overestimate the benefits of current vaccination coverage and underestimate the benefits of increasing coverage.},

	abstract = {Background
Modeling the spatio-temporal characteristics of substantiated child maltreatment risk has significant implications for child welfare policy.
Objective
This study quantifies the spatiotemporal risk of child abuse and neglect in New Mexico at the census tract level over 9 years, identifies areas of increased risk, and evaluates the role of multiple measures of social and housing insecurity on substantiated child maltreatment referrals.
Participants and Setting
Child maltreatment substantiation data across 499 census tracts from 2007 to 2015 were obtained from the New Mexico Department of Public Health.
Methods
Substantiated referral counts were analyzed within census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical space-time models using Laplace approximation. Standardized incidence ratios, spatial risk, and probability exceedances were calculated and mapped.
Results
Multiple neighborhood structural factors were associated with an increased risk of substantiated child maltreatment, including the eviction rate (Incidence Density Ratio [{IDR}] = 1.09 [95 \% {CrI} = 1.01–1.12]), rent burden ({IDR} = 1.11 [95 \% {CrI} = 1.01–1.13]), urban tracts ({IDR} = 1.36 [95 \% {CrI} = 1.05–1.77]), food desert tracts ({IDR} = 1.21 [95 \% {CrI} = 1.04–1.41]), low income tracts ({IDR} = 1.27 [95 \% {CrI} = 1.09–1.49]), percent of households with no vehicle access ([{IDR}] = 1.27 [95 \% {CrI} = .247–6.47]), and percent of persons with a disability ({IDR} = 1.05 [95 \% {CrI} = 1.03–1.06]). The racial/ethnic diversity ratio, however, was associated with lower incidence of child maltreatment allegation risk ({IDR} = .988 [95 \% {CrI} = .982–.995]).
Conclusions
Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention efforts should be aided by the characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns of household and housing vulnerability, particularly in low income, racially segregated neighborhoods.},

Study results are confounded when the effect of the exposure on the outcome, mixes with the effects of other risk and protective factors for the outcome. This problem arises when these factors are present to different degrees among the exposed and unexposed study participants, but not all differences between the groups result in confounding. Thinking about an ideal study where all of the population of interest is exposed in one universe and is unexposed in a parallel universe helps to distinguish confounders from other differences. In an actual study, an observed unexposed population is chosen to stand in for the unobserved parallel universe. Differences between this substitute population and the parallel universe result in confounding. Confounding by identified factors can be addressed analytically and through study design, but only randomization has the potential to address confounding by unmeasured factors. Nevertheless, a given randomized study may still be confounded. Confounded study results can lead to incorrect conclusions about the effect of the exposure of interest on the outcome.},

	abstract = {Confounding biases study results when the effect of the exposure on the outcome mixes with the effects of other risk and protective factors for the outcome that are present differentially by exposure status. However, not all differences between the exposed and unexposed group cause confounding. Thus, sources of confounding must be identified before they can be addressed. Confounding is absent in an ideal study where all of the population of interest is exposed in one universe and is unexposed in a parallel universe. In an actual study, an observed unexposed population represents the unobserved parallel universe. Thinking about differences between this substitute population and the unexposed parallel universe helps identify sources of confounding. These differences can then be represented in a diagram that shows how risk and protective factors for the outcome are related to the exposure. Sources of confounding identified in the diagram should be addressed analytically and through study design. However, treating all factors that differ by exposure status as confounders without considering the structure of their relation to the exposure can introduce bias. For example, conditions affected by the exposure are not confounders. There are also special types of confounding, such as time-varying confounding and unfixable confounding. It is important to evaluate carefully whether factors of interest contribute to confounding because bias can be introduced both by ignoring potential confounders and by adjusting for factors that are not confounders. The resulting bias can result in misleading conclusions about the effect of the exposure of interest on the outcome.},

The routine inclusion of mediating and moderating variables holds the promise of increasing the amount of information from outcome studies by generating practical information about interventions as well as testing theory.

This research examined the longitudinal relationships between multiple measures of cognitive readiness to parent, parenting stress (initial level and growth) and child social-emotional competence at age 3. It was hypothesized that lack of cognitive readiness to parent would predict initial level and growth in {PS} and that initial level and change in parenting stress would, in turn, would be related to poor social-emotional development. Cognitive readiness to parent was assessed at baseline shortly after childbirth; parenting stress, conceptualized as difficult child, parent-child dysfunction and parental distress, was assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postpartum (i.e. when children were 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years of age) using the Parenting Stress Index ({PSI}-{SF}; Abidin, 1995); children’s socio-emotional functioning was assessed with behavioral rating scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development ({BSID}-{II}) ({BSID}-{II}; Bayley, 1993) which was administered by professionals at age 3. Using a second order growth curve, or curve-of-factors model, the study’s hypotheses were tested with data from the Predicting and Preventing Neglect in Teen Mothers Study (2001–2007), a longitudinal study of 682 first-time mothers. Results from the latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that parenting stress predicted child socio-emotional problems. Specifically, mothers who began parenthood with high stress levels had children with lower levels of pro-social functioning (i.e. more behavior problems). Two measures of cognitive readiness to parent were associated with lower levels of postpartum {PS} at baseline but social support moderated the relationship between readiness to parent and parenting stress. Implications for interventions aimed at identifying families with children at risk for emotional and developmental problems and/or new parents who demonstrate changes in parenting stress during the postpartum period are discussed in context.},

Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse ({CPA}) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell?s model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between {CPA} and school social bonds, (b) the link between {CPA} and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between {CPA} and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the ?school achievement? effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children?s lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications stemming from our findings.},

	abstract = {Background: Although alcohol and tobacco use disorders are highly comorbid, little is known regarding the combined course of these disorders. Methods: The current study utilized latent class analysis to examine longitudinal patterns of alcohol–tobacco use disorder comorbidity. Participants were 449 young adults (baseline age, 18.5 years; 48\% male; 51\% with paternal history of alcoholism) assessed five times over 7 years. Results: Five longitudinal types of alcohol or tobacco use disorder over time were identified: nondiagnosing; developmentally limited alcohol use disorder; chronic alcohol use disorder; chronic tobacco use disorder; and comorbid alcohol and tobacco use disorder. These typologies were distinguishable on the basis of family history of alcoholism status and sex. Etiologically important third variables (alcohol expectancies, behavioral undercontrol, childhood stressors) mediated the relation between family history and the latent classes. Conclusions: Characterizations of alcohol use disorders typically fail to consider important sources of heterogeneity such as course or comorbidity. By simultaneously modeling developmental course and comorbidity with tobacco dependence, we were able to identify distinct trajectories of single and concurrent substance use disorders. Such multi-substance trajectories represent meaningful subtypes that, although sharing substantial common influences, have unique etiologic correlates. Additionally, these subtypes might represent distinct groups from the perspective of intervention strategies.},

The present study examined the relationship of {PTSD} and {MDD} with cannabis use frequency, cannabis problems, and {CUD} as well as the role of 3 coping-oriented cannabis use motives (coping with negative affect, situational anxiety, and sleep) that might underlie this relationship. Participants were veterans (N ϭ 301) deployed post-9/11/2001 recruited from a Veterans Health Administration facility in the Northeast United States based on self-reported lifetime cannabis use. There were strong unique associations between {PTSD} and {MDD} and cannabis use frequency, cannabis problems, and {CUD}. Mediation analyses revealed the 3 motives accounted, in part, for the relationship between {PTSD} and {MDD} with 3 outcomes in all cases but for {PTSD} with cannabis problems. When modeled concurrently, sleep motives, but not situational anxiety or coping with negative affect motives, significantly mediated the association between {PTSD} and {MDD} with use. Together with coping motives, sleep motives also fully mediated the effects of {PTSD} and {MDD} on {CUD} and in part the effect of {MDD} on cannabis problems. Findings indicate the important role of certain motives for better understanding the relation between {PTSD} and {MDD} with cannabis use and misuse. Future work is needed to explore the clinical utility in targeting specific cannabis use motives in the context of clinical care for mental health and {CUD}.},

	abstract = {Social scientists often present modeling results from categorical explanatory variables, such as gender, race, and marital status, as coefficients representing contrasts to a “reference” group. Although choosing the reference category may seem arbitrary, the authors argue that it is an intrinsically meaningful act that affects the interpretability of results. Reference category selection foregrounds some contrasts over others. Also, selecting a culturally dominant group as the reference can subtly reify the notion that dominant groups are the most “normal.” The authors find that three of four recently published tables in Demography and American Sociological Review that include race or gender explanatory variables use dominant groups (i.e., male or white) as the reference group. Furthermore, the tables rarely state what the reference is: only half of tables with race variables and one-fifth of tables with gender variables explicitly specify the reference category; the rest leave it up to the reader to check the methods section or simply guess. As an alternative to this apparently standard practice, the authors suggest guidelines for intentionally and responsibly choosing a reference category. The authors then discuss alternative ways to convey results from categorical explanatory variables that avoid the problems of reference categories entirely.},

Latent class analysis ({LCA}) was used to identify homogeneous, mutually exclusive “classes” of 11 of the most commonly used {ACEs}. The {LCA} resulted in four high-risk profiles and one low-risk profile, which were labeled: (1) highly abusive and dysfunctional (3.3\%; n = 1,983), (2) emotionally abusive alcoholic with parental conflict (6\%, n = 3,303), (3) sexual abuse only (4.3\%, n = 2,260), (4) emotionally abusive and alcoholic (30.3\%, n = 17,460), and (5) normative, low risk (56.3\%, n = 32,950). Compared to the low-risk class, each high-risk profile was differentially associated with adult psychosocial outcomes even when the conditional {CR} within that class was similar. The results further our understanding about the pattern of {ACEs} and the unique pathways to poor health. Implications for child welfare systems when dealing with individuals who have experienced multiple forms of early childhood maltreatment and/or household dysfunction are discussed.},

            Postpartum depression and low parental self‐efficacy ({PSE}) are risk factors for poor child behavior. Little is known, however, about the course of dual trajectories of cooccurring depressive symptoms and {PSE} or its impact on children's socioemotional development. This study sought to identify trajectories of postpartum {PSE} and depressive symptoms in new, first‐time mothers using growth mixture modeling. Results demonstrated a class of women with “low risk” (88.8\%) who manifested low levels of depression and high levels of {PSE} during the postpartum period; a second group of women, labeled “early risk” (6.3\%) with high levels of depression that decreased over time but lower levels of {PSE} that remained fairly stable; and a final trajectory group deemed the “late‐risk” class (4.9\%) with initially low levels of depression and high levels of {PSE} that significantly increased and decreased, respectively, over the period. Early childhood trauma, parenting stress, and poor parenting practices were associated membership in a high‐risk class. Mothers in the high‐risk groups reported children with more aggressive and defiant behavior at age 3. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for developing effective and sensitive interventions.

            Resumen
            La depresión posterior al parto y la autoeficacia de los padres ({PSE}) son factores de riesgo para la débil conducta del niño. Poco se sabe, sin embargo, acerca del curso de las trayectorias duales de síntomas depresivos que ocurren simultáneamente y {PSE} o su impacto en el desarrollo socioemocional de los niños. Este estudio se propuso identificar las trayectorias del {PSE} posterior al parto y los síntomas depresivos en nuevas, primerizas mamás usando un modelo de mezcla de crecimiento. Los resultados mostraron una clase de mujeres con ‘bajo riesgo’ (88.8\%) que manifestaron bajos niveles de depresión y altos niveles de {PSE} durante el período posterior al parto; un segundo grupo de mujeres, llamado ‘de temprano riesgo’ (6.3\%) con altos niveles de depresión que disminuyeron a lo largo del tiempo, pero más bajos niveles de {PSE} que se mantuvieron equitativamente estables; y un final grupo de trayectoria denominado la clase del ‘riesgo tardío’ (4.9\%) con iniciales bajos niveles de depresión y altos niveles de {PSE} que significativamente aumentaron y disminuyeron, respectivamente, a lo largo del período. El trauma en la temprana niñez, el estés de crianza, así como las débiles prácticas de crianza fueron afiliaciones asociadas dentro de una clase de alto riesgo. Las mamás en los grupos de alto riesgo reportaron niños con conductas más agresivas y desafiantes a la edad de tres años. Concluimos con una discusión de las implicaciones de nuestros resultados para desarrollar intervenciones eficaces y sensibles.

            Résumé
            La dépression postpartum et l'auto‐efficacité parentale (abrégé en français ici {AEP}) sont des facteurs de risque pour les problèmes de comportement de l'enfant. On sait peu de choses, cependant, à propos du cours des trajectoires duels des symptômes dépressifs concomitants et l'{AEP} ou son impact sur le développement socio‐émotionnel des enfants. Cette étude a cherché à identifier les trajectoires d'{AEP} postpartum et de symptômes dépressifs chez des mères étant mères pour la première fois, en utilisant un modèle de croissance mixte. Les résultats ont fait état d'une classe de femmes avec un “risque moindre” (88,8\%) qui faisaient preuve de niveaux peu élevés de dépression et de niveaux élevés d'{AEP} durant la période postpartum; un deuxième groupe de femmes, appelé “risque précoce” (6,3\%) avec des niveaux élevés de dépression qui ont décru au fil du temps et avec des niveaux plus bas d'{AEP} qui restaient relativement stables; et un groupe de trajectoire finale estimé comme étant la classe de ‘risque tardif’ (4,9\%) avec initialement des niveaux moindres de dépression et des niveaux élevés d'{AEP} qui ont respectivement augmenté et baissé de manière importante, au fil de cette période. Le trauma de la petite enfance, le stress de parentage et de mauvaises pratiques parentales étaient liés à l'appartenance à la classe à haut risque. Les mères des groupes à risque élevé ont fait état d'enfants avec un comportement plus agressif et défiant à l’âge de trois ans. Nous concluons en discutant les implications pour le développement d'interventions efficaces et sensibles.

            Zusammenfassung
            Duale Verläufe elterlicher Selbstwirksamkeit sowie depressiver Symptomatik bei postpartalen Müttern und deren Auswirkungen auf die sozio‐emotionale Anpassung im frühen Kindesalter: Ein Growth Mixture Modell
            Postpartale Depression und elterliche Selbstwirksamkeit (parental self‐efficacy; {PSE}) sind Risikofaktoren für nachteiliges kindliches Verhalten. Es ist jedoch wenig bekannt über den Verlauf gemeinsam auftretender depressiver Symptomatik und {PSE} oder deren Auswirkung auf die sozio‐emotionale Entwicklung der Kinder. In dieser Studie wurde versucht, mit Hilfe von Growth Mixture Modellierung Verläufe von postpartaler {PSE} und depressiver Symptomatik bei Erstgebärenden zu identifizieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigten drei Gruppen auf. Die erste Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “niedrigem Risiko” (88,8\%), die während der postpartalen Phase niedrige Depressions‐ und hohe {PSE}‐Werte hatten. Die zweite Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “frühem Risiko” (6,3\%), die anfänglich hohe aber im Laufe der Zeit abnehmende Depressionswerte und niedrigere, ziemlich stabil bleibenden {PSE}‐Werte hatten. Die letzte Verlaufs‐Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “spätem Risiko” (4,9\%), die anfänglich niedrige Depressions‐ und hohe {PSE}‐Werte hatten, die im Laufe der Zeit signifikant anstiegen bzw. abnahmen. Frühkindliches Trauma, elterlicher Stress und nachteilige Erziehungspraktiken waren mit der Zugehörigkeit zu einer Hochrisikoklasse assoziiert. Mütter in den Hochrisikogruppen berichteten von Kindern mit mehr aggressivem und trotzigem Verhalten im Alter von drei Jahren. Abschließend werden die Implikationen unserer Ergebnisse für die Entwicklung effektiver und sensibler Interventionen diskutiert.

            第一子産後の母親における育児自己効力感及び抑うつ症状と早期幼児期の社会情緒的適応の2つの軌跡:成長混合モデル
            産後うつと育児自己効力感 ({PSE}) は子どもの問題行動を引き起こす危険因子である。しかし、併発する抑うつ症状と自己効力感あるいはその影響による子どもの社会情緒の発達がたどる2つの軌跡についてはほとんど知られていない。この研究は成長混合モデリングを用いて、第一子産後の母親に生じる育児自己効力感と抑うつ症状の軌跡を同定しようとするものである。結果は以下のようであった。‘低リスク’の女性グループ (88.8％) は、産後の抑うつレベルが低く、育児自己効力感が高かった。第二グループ (6.3％) の女性は‘早期リスク’とされ、抑うつレベルが高くても時間経過で治まるものだが、育児自己効力感は低くその後も変わらない。最後の軌跡のグループ (4.9％) は‘後期リスク’と見なされるが、はじめ抑うつレベルは低く育児自己効力感は高いのだが、時を経る中でそれぞれ大幅に上がり、そして下がる。早期幼児期のトラウマ、育児ストレス、そして未熟な育児実践が、高リスクに伴って見られた。高リスクグループの母親は3歳時の子どもが攻撃的で反抗的だったと報告した。私達は、この研究結果の意味を検討して効果的で慎重な介入を開発することとする。

            摘要
            产后抑郁症和父母自我效能感 ({PSE}) 是儿童不良行为的危险因素。然而, 关于抑郁症状和{PSE同时发生的双轨迹过程及其对儿童社交情感发展的影响知之甚少}。本研究试图通过生长混合模型来确定初产母亲产后{PSE和抑郁症状的发展轨迹}。结果显示, 第一组“低风险”女性 (88.8\%) 在产后表现出低水平的抑郁和高水平的{PSE};第二组女性, 被标记为“早期风险” (6.3\%) , 其抑郁程度会随着时间的推移而降低, 但{PSE水平较低并保持相当稳定};最后一个轨迹组认为是“晚期风险”类别 (4.9\%) , 其最初具有低水平的抑郁和高水平的{PSE}, 但在这段时间内分别显著增加和减少。儿童早期创伤、育儿压力和不良的育儿习惯与高风险类别的组员身份有关。高危组的母亲报告说, 孩子在三岁时表现出更具攻击性和挑衅性的行为。最后, 我们讨论了研究结果对制定有效和敏感的干预措施的影响。

            المسارات المزدوجة للفعالية الذاتية للتربية الوالدية وأعراض الاكتئاب عند الأمهات الجديدات بعد الولادة والتكيف الاجتماعي العاطفي في مرحلة الطفولة المبكرة: نموذج خليط النمو
            الاكتئاب بعد الولادة والفعالية الذاتية للوالدين({PSE}) هي عوامل خطر لسوء سلوك الطفل. ومع ذلك، لا يعرف الكثير عن تطور المسار المزدوج لأعراض الاكتئاب المتزامنة والكفاءة الذاتية للتربية الوالدية أو تأثيرها على النمو الاجتماعي العاطفي للأطفال. سعت هذه الدراسة إلى تحديد مسارات{PSE} بعد الولادة وأعراض الاكتئاب عند الأمهات الجدد لأول مرة باستخدام نمذجة خليط النمو . وأظهرت النتائج وجود فئة من النساء ذوات “المخاطر المنخفضة” (88.8 في المائة) من النساء اللاتي أظهرن مستويات منخفضة من الاكتئاب ومستويات عالية من {PSE} خلال فترة ما بعد الولادة؛ ومجموعة ثانية من النساء، وصفت ب “الخطر المبكر” (6.3٪) مع مستويات عالية من الاكتئاب انخفضت مع مرور الوقت ومستويات منخفضة من {PSE} والتي ظلت مستقرة إلى حد ما. كما وجدت مجموعة أخيرة وصفت بمجموعة “المخاطر المتأخرة” (4.9٪) مع مستويات منخفضة في البداية من الاكتئاب وارتفاع مستويات {PSE} والتي زادت وانخفضت بشكل ملحوظ ، على التوالي، على مدى فترة الدراسة. وارتبطت صدمة الطفولة المبكرة، والإجهاد الأبوي، وسوء ممارسات التربية بالانتماء إلى أحد هذه المجموعات ذات المخاطرة العالية. وأبلغت الأمهات في فئات المخاطرة العالية عن أطفال يعانون من سلوك أكثر عدوانية وعناداً في سن الثالثة. وتختم الدراسة بمناقشة تطبيقات النتائج لتطوير تدخلات فعالة وحساسة.},

	abstract = {Stratification allows to control for confounding by creating two or more categories or subgroups in which the confounding variable either does not vary or does not vary very much. The Mantel-Haenszel formula is applied in cohort and in case-control studies to calculate an overall, unconfounded, effect estimate of a given exposure for a specific outcome by combining stratum-specific relative risks ({RR}) or odds ratios ({OR}). Stratum-specific {RRs} or {ORs} are calculated within each stratum of the confounding variable and compared with the corresponding effect estimates in the whole group (that is, with the unstratified {RR} or {OR}). The use of the Mantel-Haenszel formula presents some limitations: (1) if there is more than a single confounder, the application of this formula is laborious and demands a relatively large sample size, and (2) this method requires continuous confounders to be constrained into a limited number of categories thus potentially generating residual confounding (a phenomenon particularly relevant when the variable is categorized into few strata). In the stratified analysis, residual confounding can be minimized by increasing the number of strata, a possibility strictly dependent on sample size.},
