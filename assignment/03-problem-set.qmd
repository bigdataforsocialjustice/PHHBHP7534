# Problem set 3

For this assignment submit an Rmarkdown file and send it to my email with the subject "Problem Set 3" by Feb 1, 2024.

::: {.callout-note}
**Hint:** This assignment asks you to replicate my mediation analysis code by replacing the independent and mediator variables.
:::

```{r}
library(foreign)
library(dplyr)
library(processR)
```

We are still using the dataset we used in the [moderation example](example/moderation.qmd) for this assignment. However, we will test whether depressive symptoms (cidi1) mediates the association between post-traumatic stress symptoms (tra1) and delinquent behaviors (bcdel1).

::: {.callout-note}
You should have familiarity with the most common measures for psychological 'disorders.' For example, the CIDI questions (which stands for Composite International Diagnostic Interview) are [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/cidi_quex.pdf). The CIDI scale is meant to assess major depressive disorder by asking respondents the questions listed in the diagnostic assessment. We will talk about measurement next week, for now ask yourself whether you think this is a good question (E1, page 24): In the past 12 months, have you had a period of two weeks or longer when you felt sad or depressed or empty? 
:::

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/barboza-salerno.1/Downloads/")
source("process.R")
mediation_example = tibble::as_tibble(read.spss("moderation.sav", use.value.labels = F, to.data.frame = T))

```

Remove missingness (na)

```{r}
mediation_example <- mediation_example %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(tra1) & !is.na(cidi1) & !is.na(bcdel1))
```

## The conceptual model
The conceptual model that illustrates those relationships is provided below. For the simple mediation model, both conceptual and statistical diagrams are the same. **NOTE** simple mediation is model 4, see the Hayes macro template I provided to you in the lecture.


```{r}
labels=list(X="PTSS",M="CIDI",Y="DELIN")
```

Notice I used the option `rady` to increase the y dimension of the box so that the words will fit. 

Note the use of the package `processR` below.

## A. Describe the conceptual model
```{r}
processR::pmacroModel(4,labels=labels, rady = 0.07)
```

## B. Write the code to display the statistical diagram below

```{r, echo = FALSE}
processR::statisticalDiagram(4,labels=labels, rady = 0.07)
```

Note that we must remove missing values before the model will run. This is part of the 'trial and error' common in R programming. Whereas we removed missing values above, it is **good practice** to include the option `na.rm = T` **anytime you are calculating the mean, standard deviation, or any other descriptive measure.** If you do not include this option, and your variable has missing data, R will NOT calculate the statistic, leaving you sad and frustrated.

Below is the same code we used before to mean center the variable for PTSS (tra1). 

```{r}
mediation_example$tra1_mean <- 
  mediation_example$tra1 - mean(mediation_example$tra1, na.rm = T)
```

## C. Write the code to mean center the `cidi1` variable.
```{r, echo = F}
mediation_example$cidi1_mean <- 
  mediation_example$cidi1 - mean(mediation_example$cidi1, na.rm = T)
```

Below is a quick plot using `Base R` to visualize the variables.

## D. Describe the relationship between the two variables PTSS (tra1_mean) and DELINQ

```{r}
plot(y=mediation_example$bcdel1, 
     x=mediation_example$tra1_mean,
     xlab = "PTSS", ylab = "DELINQ")
```

## E. Describe the relationship between the two variables, TRA1 (tra1_mean) and CIDI1 (cidi1_mean). 
```{r}
plot(y=mediation_example$tra1_mean, 
     x=mediation_example$cidi1_mean,
     xlab = "CIDI", ylab = "PTSS")
abline(h = mean(mediation_example$tra1_mean), col = "blue", lwd = 4, lty = 4) 
abline(v = mean(mediation_example$cidi1_mean), col = "blue", lwd = 4, lty = 4) 
```

## F. The above figure has four quadrants that can be labeled as shown below. Describe each of the quadrants and think of an implication of being in each quadrant.

![Quadrants](../slides/img/01/quads.png)

## Below is the code that returns the correlation between the variables. 

```{r}

cor(mediation_example$tra1_mean, mediation_example$cidi1_mean)
cor(mediation_example$bcdel1, mediation_example$cidi1_mean)
```
## G. Write the code to return the correlation between tra1_mean and bcdel1. The result is below.
```{r, echo = F}
cor(mediation_example$tra1_mean, mediation_example$bcdel1)
```

Here is the result for the mediation model.
```{r results = 'hide'}
result <- process(
  data = mediation_example, 
  y = "bcdel1", 
  x = "tra1", 
  m = "cidi1", 
  total = 1, 
  normal = 1, 
  model = 4, 
  seed = 31216)
```

## H. Complete the sentences
The `Total effect of X on Y:` is the effect of ...

The direct effect labeled `Direct effect of X on Y:` summarizes the effect of ...

The indirect effect labeled `Indirect effect(s) of X on Y:` is the ...

## I. Verify that the a path multiplied by the b path is equal to the mediation effect.

## J. The proportion of the total effect (PTSS' effect on DELINQ) that is mediated by depressive symptoms is defined as the ratio of the indirect to the total effect. What proportion of the total effect is mediated by depressive symptoms?

## K. Do depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between PTSS and DELINQ? What is an implication that follows from the result?
