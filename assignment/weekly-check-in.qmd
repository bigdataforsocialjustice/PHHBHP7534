title: "Weekly check-in"
---

PhD students will check in with me weekly beginning Week 4. There will be 9 weekly checkins between Weeks 4 - 12 to make sure that your research paper is on track to be completed, and that the course is going satisfactorily for you (that is, assignments and objectives are clear, you are meeting the learning objectives particularly around R/Rstudio, etc.). We do not have to meet unless you want to. You can simply email me the answers to the following questions each week:

1. What **three (3)** things did you learn this week that you did not know?
2. What **three (3)** new understandings did you take-away that makes you a more effective researcher, and what new approach will facilitate your understanding about marginalized groups? 
2. What if anything was unclear to you about the assignments, learning objectives, etc. and what can be improved?    

Note: this will be graded as you can see in the [grading table.](/syllabus.qmd#assignments-and-grades)
