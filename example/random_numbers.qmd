## Introduction

In class we discussed probability sampling, including simple random sampling, stratefied sampling and cluster sampling. This is a simple script to demonstrate how we can use built-in functions to simulate random numbers in R and use those to select a sample from a generated **hypothetical** list of student IDs. The question of interest is: how many students at some hypothetical university are full-time workers?

::: {.callout-note icon=true} 
For a challenge, write the code to loop through the records and create a datafile contining the results with columns for the student ID and an indicator for whether the student works or not.
:::

#### Generate random digits between 1 and 999999

```{r}
library(dplyr)
random_number <- runif(500, min = 1, max = 999999)
```

#### Make sure we have whole numbers, student IDs are not digits

```{r}
number <- floor(random_number)
```

#### Pad numbers that are not 6 digits with a "0"

```{r}
number <- stringr::str_pad(number, 6, side="left", pad="0")
```

#### Create dataset of 20 students, with a variable = 1 if they work

```{r}
m <- 20
n <- 2
df_workstudy <- data.frame(matrix(0, nrow = m, ncol = n, dimnames = list(NULL, paste0("ColumnName_", 1:n))) )

```

#### Remane the columns

```{r}
colnames(df_workstudy)[1] <- "StuID"
colnames(df_workstudy)[2] <- "Works"
```

#### create dummy data of students and work condition (THESE DATA ARE FAKE!!)

```{r}
df_workstudy$StuID <- c(
  902372,
  351737,
  989354,
  353513,
  891221,
  133616,
  258885,
  860899,
  852253,
  704750,
  573238,
  31707,
  432924,
  856104,
  237756,
  866992,
  905184,
  727601,
  761719,
  86299
  )
df_workstudy$Works <- c(0, 0, 1,  1, 1,  0, 0, 0, 1,  1, 1,  1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 ,0,  0)

```

#### We have a 6 digit ID with padded 0s if the number is less than 6, we we add 0s to the numbers

```{r}
df_workstudy$StuID <- stringr::str_pad(df_workstudy$StuID, 6, side="left", pad="0")
```

#### Is the student ID in the dataframe of student IDs

```{r }
percent_students_work <- df_workstudy %>% filter(StuID %in% number)

```

#### **IF** the student works, record a `1` in the `Works` column otherwise record `0`. Then, re-run until you have 500 people in the sample.

```{r}
percent_students_work # this student would be selected for inclusion in the sample
```
#### If there is a match record whether the student works. This student did work. Then re-run until you get another 'hit' or taken on the challenge above.
