## SPSS

### Installing Extensions & Custom Dialog boxes in SPSS
SPSS offers a few different ways of incorporating additional packages. We will cover the two most common

#### Custom dialog boxes
- To install a custom dialog box go to 'Extensions' from the file menu, then "Utilities" and "Install Custom Dialog" as shown below

- Compatible custom dialog packages have the file extension .spd
- This requires you to identify and have the package downloaded onto your computer

#### The Process Macro
One of the dialog packages I use most is called PROCESS written by Andrew Hayes. It provides a user interface for mediation, moderation and mediated moderation models. We review these models in Stats II.

This [website](https://processmacro.org/) has more information about the process macro. 

- Note: there are about 100 [process model templates](https://github.com/bigdataforsocialjustice/PHHBHP7534/blob/main/process_template.pdf) available for these models.
