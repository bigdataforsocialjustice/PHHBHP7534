# Downloading Data

I am connecting to the web portal from the [Medical Examiner](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Public-Safety/Medical-Examiner-Case-Archive/cjeq-bs86/about_data) below. The dataset contains information about deaths that occurred in Cook County that were under the Medical Examinerâ€™s jurisdiction. We will use this to show how to download, select, filter, and summarize data. The example corresponds to our discussion of variables for this week.

The example requires the following packages.
```{r}
library(RSocrata)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
options(scipen=10000)
```

```{r}

#https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/odata/v4/cjeq-bs86
df <-   read.socrata("https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/odata/v4/cjeq-bs86")
head(df)
```
# Wrangling
For the sake of example, say that I am interested in infant mortality disparities. I am going download, select, filter and summarize the data in one line of code. Notice that there are over 80,000 records as it is now.

Select three variables, `age`, `gender` and `race`
```{r}
df <- read.socrata("https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/odata/v4/cjeq-bs86") %>%
  select(age, gender, race) 
```

Filter the data to return ages less than or equal to 1 and only Black or White
```{r}
df <- read.socrata("https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/odata/v4/cjeq-bs86") %>%
  select(age, gender, race) %>%
  filter(age <= 1 & (race == "Black" | race == "White")) 
```

Group by race to get the counts for Black and Whites (query: what would be returned if group_by was NOT used?)
Return a simple count `n()` and store it in a variable called `number`

```{r}
df <- read.socrata("https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/odata/v4/cjeq-bs86") %>%
  select(age, gender, race) %>%
  filter(age <= 1 & (race == "Black" | race == "White")) %>%
  group_by(race) %>% summarize(number = n())

df
```

Plot the results using ggplot
```{r}
read.socrata("https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/odata/v4/cjeq-bs86") %>%
  select(age, gender, race) %>%
  filter(age <= 1 & (race == "Black" | race == "White")) %>%
  group_by(race) %>% summarize(number = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = number)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ggtitle("Disparities in Infant Mortality by Race, Chicago Illinois")
```
