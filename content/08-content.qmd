## Lecture Notes

The lecture notes for today can be downloaded [here](/slides/phhbhp7534_measurement_threats.pdf) as pdf or
[here](/slides/phhbhp7534_measurement_threats.pptx) as a PPTX

## In-class examples

- Example 1: Calculating reliability coefficients in R [here](/example/cronbachs.qmd)

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/04-slides")
slide_tabs(slide_details, "/slides/day8.html")
```

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
