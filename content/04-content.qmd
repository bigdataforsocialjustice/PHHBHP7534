### Required Reading for PhD Students (and recommended for others)

- Andrew Hayes' book entitled [*Mediation, Moderation and Conditional Process Models*](https://github.com/bigdataforsocialjustice/PHHBHP7534/blob/main/reading/mediation_hayes.pdf) is an excellent and rigorous introduction. Read Chapters 3 *The Simple Mediation Model* and Chapter 7: *Fundamentals of Moderation Analysis*.

### Advanced Mediation Models

For an example of when I used these models in my own work, see [@elise_barboza_child_2021]
Parallel Mediation Model:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("example", "lab4", "parallel_mediators.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Sequential mediation model: 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("example", "lab4", "sequential_mediators.png"), error = FALSE)
```
