## Readings

### Today's Assignments

- {{< fa book >}} Read [this introduction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VRAZIafADY2UIrRebX8hotZEB-sjtrWxvAyPFflH5YI/view) to QGIS available from the [Geographic Information Systems: QGIS](https://guides.nyu.edu/gis/qgis) website at New York University

### Your tasks

-   [ ] Download and install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
-   [ ] Navigate to the [Census website](http://data.census.gov) and familiarize yourself with the available topics
-   [ ] Navigate to the Census Tigerline website and familiarize yourself with the types of boundaries you can map
-   [ ] Read my write up on [Making Maps in R](https://phhbhp7534.netlify.app/example/mapping%20census.html)
-   [ ] Download the QGIS plugins HCMGIS (baselayers) and MMQGIS (geocoding)

## Lecture Notes & in-class materials

The lecture notes for today can be downloaded [here](/slides/maps.pdf) which was covered over two days. The second day we focused on student projects including:

- We mappped the context of [vaccine hesitancy in Franklin County](https://github.com/bigdataforsocialjustice/PHHBHP7534/blob/main/vaccine.zip), which used the [COI's redlining data](https://www.diversitydatakids.org/search?search=redlining) **based on 2020 neighborhoods**, the [CDC's SVI](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html) and the [COTA bus routes](https://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=234f107841f540119fea7d45c56978e8#overview). It would be easy to merge in data from the [National Walkability Index](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/national-walkability-index-user-guide-and-methodology) or as I noted in class [Walk Score Professional](https://www.walkscore.com/) can also be downloaded using their API (and R).

- We mapped [colon cancer screening](colon.zip) which used the [CDC's Places dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Census-Tract-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2023-/yjkw-uj5s/about_data); 

![Target Areas for Colon Cancer Screening](colon.png)

- We used the HCQGIS plugin in QGIS to geocode the [school-based health centers](health.zip) in Cleveland, Ohio.

I encourage you to download these files and see if you can make the maps we made in class. I will include a video below that illustrates how I made these maps so you can follow that.

### Software Packages

-   [Add-on Packages &
    Modules](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/databootcamp/add-on-packages-&-modules.html)
    offer additional functionality and are available for all software
    programs listed above

### ðŸ“¦ Additional Resources

-   [Creating Beautiful Demographic Maps](http://zevross.com/blog/2018/10/02/creating-beautiful-demographic-maps-in-r-with-the-tidycensus-and-tmap-packages/) Another GREAT resource to facilitate mapping geospatial data in R
-   [Static Maps](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/mapping/static_maps/static-maps/) More information about how to use geospatial data in analyses with an introductory focus and videos
- [Spatial Data Workshop](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/2020-03-12-geospatial-data-workshop/) has a lot of resources
