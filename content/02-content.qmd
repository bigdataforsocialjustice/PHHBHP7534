## Recommended readings

The following reading is a great resources, and I will incorporate some of the material in the lecture.

- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 4. Singleton Jr, R. (2017). [Approaches to social research.](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/approaches-to-social-research-9780190614249?cc=us&lang=en&) Oxford University Press. 

### Make sure you have completed these tasks by the end of the week

-   [ ] Download and install [R/Rstudio](/resource/install.qmd)
-   [ ] Download and install [Jamovi Desktop](https://www.jamovi.org)
-   [ ] Download and install [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/download/)
-   [ ] Download and install [Zotero](/resource/zotero.qmd)
-   [ ] Connect to the course [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T06BQF8BPP0/C06BZJ1HHS8)
-   [ ] (optional) Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)

### Your tasks for today

-   [ ] Think of a research question you want to pursue this semester.
-   [ ] Complete [Problem Set 1](/assignment/01-problem-set.qmd). The [instructions for submission](/assignment/01-problem-set.html#task-3-work-with-r) are located in the assignment 

### Notes

- If you are an MPH student, my suggestion is that you select a research topic that is aligned with a final assessment you need to graduate (e.g., APE)
- If you are a PhD student, make sure you select a question that can be answered within the semester. This means
  - Identifying an already existing dataset. 
  - To get you started, look at the data I compiled last summer for the [data bootcamp](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/databootcamp/) in Social Work by [clicking here](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/databootcamp/datasets.html); and
  - Collaborating with myself, your advisor, and/or a colleague; and
  - The question must be approved by me; and
  - The topic is due by next class. If you have no topic by then, I will assign a topic to you.

### In-class activities
- Literature search
- Introduction to [Zotero](/resource/zotero.qmd)
  - Google scholar/Zotero integration
  - Word/Zotero integration
  - Sharing Zotero files
  - Creating Zotero profiles
- Integrating Zotero into Obsidian (time permitting)
