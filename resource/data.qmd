### What is data?

Data comes in a variety of formats. When we think about data we typically think about structured data, for example data that can be imported nicely into Excel or SPPS. There are a number of alternative data formats that come in a variety of data types from many different data sources. The links below demonstrate these data formats using existing sources. We begin to learn how to analyze the data using innovative data science packages. I have chosen to concentrate on available software that is easy to use, and can facilitate the interpretation, analysis and visualization of data beyond the typical tools (e.g., SPSS). I will note the benefits and drawbacks for each package we review.

*Note:* Throughout this class, I will provide examples from my own work to illustrate how I have applied these tools. This includes a couple of web scraping applications (one which scrapes data from the [Los Angeles Homicide Report](https://homicide.latimes.com/) and one to automate downloading data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets.html) The goal is to show you what can be done, with the disclaimer that you will probably not be able to do this by the end of this course. Learning about data is a long-term goal but I am here to help you if at some point you want to implement any of this for your own work.

### Show me the data!

There is tons of data available to download on the internet from reliable sources. I am going to review the datasets that I find most interesting and useful for social work. We will select a few datasets to analyze, visualize, and map. This requires knowing how to download and merge the data for analysis. These datasets provide a rich source of contextual information for your research, including your dissertation. As you will see, knowing about them, how to use them, and how to incorporate them into your research, is extremely powerful.


## 🎯 Your Tasks

#### Data Types

Before starting an analysis it is important to know the kind of data that you have. This requires understanding not only the distinction between qualitative and quantitative data, but also the difference between structured and unstructured data, time series data, spatial data, etc. We wills start by briefly reviewing the different types of data that are available and the multiple ways in which data can be measured. This is of particular importance because the analysis you choose is driven by the type of data you have. In other words, you cannot make your data fit the analysis you know, but rather you must learn how to analyze the data you have. 

- Qualitative v Quantitative 
- Structured v unstructured data
- Data types 
- Data innovation 
    - being creative with data: here we address the question: what really constitutes data? 
    
Over the years, I have learned that even advanced students do not really know how to properly identify data that *can be used* in an analysis. 
  
Below are some examples of how I have utilized different data sources in my analyses. 

1. [Los Angeles Homicide Report](https://homicide.latimes.com/) See how I've scraped this website and used the data in my own work --\> [Final web scrap medium\|Female Homicide Victims 2000-2023](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/databootcamp/final-web-scrap-medium.html) 

2. [Mapping Attacks on LGBTQ Rights in U.S. State Legislatures \| American Civil Liberties Union (aclu.org)](https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights) 

3. [Child Maltreatment and Data Statistics –
PCAKY](https://pcaky.org/information-data/child-maltreatment-and-data-statistics/) by County in Kentucky 

4. [California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/) - [[Example 1](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/databootcamp/example-1.html) uses the data set [Hospice Utilization - Patient Demographics - Datasets - California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/hospice-utilization-patient-demographics)
to explore differences in referral types by race/ethnicity and county. 

5. Other examples 

- Show me the data 
- Finding, downloading and filtering data on the Internet 
- Publicly available [Datasets](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/databootcamp/datasets.html) for public health research 
- Examples 
    - How does the CDC's social vulnerability index ([SVI]) in Franklin County compare to Los Angeles County? 
    - What is the relationship between [In-school suspensions and academic achievement](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/databootcamp/in-school-suspensions-and-academic-achievement.html) for schools in the state of Ohio? 
    - How can I download the [area level deprivation index]() to use in my own research? ---

#### ❓ Your turn

-   [ ] Identify a dataset that is not listed above
-   [ ] Find the codebook associated with the dataset
-   [ ] Download the data
    -   What limitations are there for analyzing the data?
    -   What types of research questions have these data been used to
        address?
    -   How could you use the data in your own research?
