### Statistical Software Packages

There are a wide variety of different open source and proprietary
software tools that are simple to learn and make data management and
analysis easier, more effective and fun. Here is my list of the most
important tools to be familiar with. The items in bold are the software
that we will use during the course of the week.

The software is listed by availability (i.e., open source, license,
package add-on)

#### Open Source Software

-   **R**: IMHO the best statistical analysis tool ever created (yes, better than python for statistics)
    -   In this class we will use both R and RStudio (the GUI for R) which can be downloaded here [RStudio Desktop -
        Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) 
-   [**jamovi**](https://www.jamovi.org/features.html): the next best
    option, it is built on an R framework, nobody will know you are NOT
    using R :)
    -   jamovi is a new ‚Äú3rd generation‚Äù statistical spreadsheet.
        designed from the ground up to be easy to use. jamovi is a
        compelling alternative to costly statistical products such as
        SPSS and SAS. It is also a simpler alternative to R that is
        built on top of the R statistical language
    -   üåê **Analyses**: jamovi provides a complete suite of analyses
        for (not just) the social sciences; t-tests, ANOVAs, correlation
        and regression, non-parametric tests, contingency tables,
        reliability and factor analysis. The [jamovi
        library](https://www.jamovi.org/library.html)¬†contains many more
        libraries that will allow you to perform additional analyses
        from simple crosstabs to multilevel modeling and more.
    -   üåê**Excel integration**: jamovi is a fully functional
        spreadsheet, immediately familiar to anyone. Enter, copy/paste
        data, filter rows, compute new values, perform transforms across
        many columns at once ‚Äì jamovi provides a streamlined spreadsheet
        experience, optimized for statistical data.
    -   üåê **R syntax**: Love R? Check out jamovi's ‚Äúsyntax mode‚Äù, where
        the underlying R syntax for each analysis is made available.
        Just copy and paste this into R for a seamless transition.
        Alternatively, run R code directly inside jamovi with¬†[the Rj
        Editor](https://blog.jamovi.org/2018/07/30/rj.html).
    -   There are two versions of jamovi
        -   jamovi Cloud
        -   [jamovi desktop - jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html) -- downloads
            and installs jamovi onto your desktop
            -   It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux
-   [JASP - A Fresh Way to Do Statistics
    (jasp-stats.org)](https://jasp-stats.org/)
    -   "Just Another Statistics Program" JASP offers another great
        alternative to SPSS
    -   In some ways JASP is better than jamovi, but it seems less
        stable and so it is my second best option
    -   There are some benefits to using JASP including flexibility in
        making plots and nice visualizations for the statistical
        analyses you are conducting
    -   [Click here](https://jasp-stats.org/download/) to download JASP
    -   JASP in particular provides a great way to both learn statistics
        and R at the same time
    -   Let's take a look at the data library in JASP now
-   [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/): "Quantum Geographical Information
    Systems" allows you to do geospatial analysis like a (ArcGIS) pro --
    QGIS is great for creating, editing, visualizing, analyzing and
    publishing geospatial information
    -   The [Applications
        (qgis.org)](https://qgis.org/en/site/about/features.html) page
        gives you a sense of all the cool things you can do with QGIS
    -   To download the software [Click
        here](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
-   [PSPP - GNU Project - Free Software
    Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/) is an open source
    equivalent to SPSS and it is freely downloadable. It is not very
    robust and so I would not recommend it. 
    
#### Proprietary Software

 OSU has obtained a license for the following software packages:
  
  -   **SPSS**: its like a necessary evil - everyone must know how to use SPSS. There are some things that are actually easier in SPSS
  -   **SAS**: ugh!
  -   **EXCEL**: can be great to clean your data, particularly if you
       use the built-in functions.
  -   **ArcGIS Map, Pro**
  -   **jmp**: this is a very cool data science program from the
        makers of SAS (the archaic and soon to be extinct software
        program)
