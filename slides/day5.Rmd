# A note on measurement

---

Many issues involve a comparison between two proportions (or probabilities). 

- How would you describe the disparity in pass (or fail) rates (and what are the problems of interpretation)?
  
  - The difference in pass (fail) rates
  - The ratio of the pass (fail) rates
  - The odds ratio 
  
---
# Example

Consider the example of a test taken by males and females on which males are observed to have a higher pass rate. Assume that the passage rate for males is 97% and the passage rate for females is 90%

- What is the difference in pass rates?
- What is the difference in fail rates?

---
# Ratio of pass/fail rates

If the passage rate for males is 97% and the passage rate for females is 90%.

What is the ratio of the pass rates? interpretation?

--

${\huge .97 \over \huge .90} = \Large 1.07$

--

What is the ratio of the fail rates? interpretation?

--

${\huge .10 \over \huge .03} = \Large 3.33$

---

# Odds of passing

What are the odds of passing for males and females?

The odds of passing for males

$Odds = {p_M \over 1-p_M} = {.97 \over 1-.97} = {.97 \over .03} = 32.3:1$

--

The odds of passing for females

$Odds = {p_W \over 1-p_W} = {.90 \over 1-.90} = {.90 \over .10} = 9:1$

--

- for every 9 females that pass, 1 will not pass 
- for every female that fails, 9 will not fail

---

# Odds of failing  
The odds ratio of the fail rates is defined as the odds of failing for females divided by the odds of failing for males.

Divide the two odds calculated above of failing for females (1 in 9) and males (3 in 97)

$OR = {{1 \over 9} \over {3 \over 97}} = {{97 \over 27} }= 3.6$

# Odds of passing
The odds ratio of the pass rates is defined as the odds of passing for females divided by the odds of passing failing for males.

Divide the two odds calculated above of passing for females and males

$OR = {{9 \over 1} \over {97 \over 3}} = {{27 \over 97} }= .278$

--

The OR is invariant

# Research Questions & Hypotheses

---

Researchers seek to explain the causes of some phenomenon (e.g., IPV)

How do we plan scientific inquiry?

Mostly we are interested in cause and effect

Causation in the focus of explanatory research

Cause in social sciences is inherengly probablistic (focus on likelihoods)

- Children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to develop internalizing syndromes

Two primary modes of explanation
- Ideographic
- Nomothetic

---
# Criteria for establishing causality

Idiographic posited by Maxwell (2005)

- How credible and believable it is; and
- Whether rival hypotheses have been seriously considered, and ruled out

Nomothetic posited by Shadish, Cook, & Campbell (2002)

- Any relationship that satisfies the following criteria is causal
---
# Establishing causality

4 Criteria

- **Covariation**: Empirical (i.e., statistical) relationship between variables; if A changes, B must also change. 
  - This is necessary, but not sufficient, i.e., not enough alone to show cause
--

- **Temporal order**: (cause precedes effect) (most often timing is unclear): IV comes before DV

--

- **Non-spuriousness**: No alternative explanations—no spurious other variable(s) affecting the initial relationship

--

- **Theoretical lens**: Theory that explains the relationships

--

Does poverty cause crime?

---
# Poverty Causes Crime

**Empirical relationship:** two variables must covary or in other words there must be some *statistically significant* correlation between them 

– But, how big must the correlation be? 

**Temporal order:** Which comes first poverty or crime? 

**Spurious relationship:** What are some possible confounders?

# Necessary v. Sufficient Causes
“Discovering one cause that is both necessary and sufficient is the most satisfying outcome of explanatory research.”

--

Within the probabilistic model, two types of causes:

A statement is a **sufficient condition** for another statement if the truth of the first would guarantee the truth of the second. Represents a condition that, if it is present, guarantees that the effect will occur

--

A statement is a **necessary condition** for a second if the truth of the second statment is necessary for the truth of the first statment. Represents a condition that must be present for the effect to occur

--

To get your MPH at OSU, all university-related fees must be paid.  i.e., to get your degree, you must pay your fees. *Necessary or Sufficient*

--

If you plead guilty for murder, you will go to jail. *Necessary or Sufficient*

# Example

Several times we have discussed the relation between ACEs and some health outcome. Describe the conditions for each of the following that would lead us to conclude that ACEs are a:

- A sufficient cause
- A necessary cause
- A necessary and sufficient cause

Now change the example to examine the relation between poverty and crime

- A sufficient cause
- A necessary cause
- A necessary and sufficient cause

# Example

Becker, K., El-Faddagh, M., Schmidt, M. H., & Laucht, M. (2007). Is the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) associated with harm avoidance and internalising problems in childhood and adolescence?. Journal of Neural Transmission, 114, 395-402.

The S allele of the 5-HTTLPR has been associated with anxiety-related behavioural traits and harm avoidance. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is suggested to modulate the serotonergic response to stress, **meaning that individuals carrying the SS genotype who have significant stress histories may tend to develop depressive symptoms.** 

--

In the Mannheim Study of Risk Children, which followed a cohort of n = 384 from birth to adolescence, the association of 5-HTTLPR with harm avoidance and internalising problems was examined, including gender and early life stress as possible moderators. Child and adolescent characteristics were assessed using the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory, the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Youth Self Report. Early life stress was determined by a risk index measuring the presence of 11 adversity factors. Results did not reveal an association with 5-HTTLPR genotype. There were no moderating effects of early life stress or gender. 

--

One explanation for the negative findings is that the S allele is a *Necessary/Sufficient* cause.

---

# More Causality Confusion

You MUST think through the different possible explanations for your results.

**Equifinality**: one outcome can have many causes

--

Individuals with substance use disorder come from "good" homes.

--

**Multifinality**: different outcomes can result from one common factor

--

Adults who experienced early child trauma graduate from college and refrain from committing crime.

# Research Questions

# Research Questions
Research entails asking very specific questions and testing very specific hypotheses 

Broad questions are usually broken into smaller, testable hypotheses or questions

Resarch questions are also called objective and/or aims 

- The RQ helps focus the hypothesis to provide evidence in favor or against, not prove, the RQ

---
# Part I: What is an interesting RQ?

Ask yourself: "How can I make what I do or know now, no matter how adequate it seems, look outdated or old fashioned as soon as possible?"

# Social "Disorganization" Theory

Decades of research has established the importance of acknowledging the broader ecological and community systems (Drake & Pandey, 1996) that are directly or indirectly associated with child maltreatment substantiations, particularly in impoverished neighborhoods. Operating within this framework, research has identified a broad array of ecological factors that strain the interpersonal relations between children and caregivers (Molnar et al., 2016). However, economic hardship, defined by income poverty, is the most widely cited ecological factor associated with substantiated child maltreatment (Thomas & Waldfogel, 2022) and social disorganization theory has become its primary organizing framework (Garbarino and Sherman, 1980, Thomas and Waldfogel, 2022, Zuravin, 1989). According to social disorganization theory, social and economic “disorder” results in low levels of collective efficacy and community cohesion which hinders the ability of community members to “know and care about each other, work together, and remember past outcomes from efforts to influence other community problems” (Mustaine et al., 2014, p. 174).

# Unemployment versus Labor Market

Past research has demonstrated a link between certain labor market characteristics and substantiated child maltreatment risk including caregiver unemployment (Dery & Arapis, 2022), job loss (Schenck-Fontaine et al., 2017) and employment instability (Cai, 2021). However, even though the labor market is broader and more complex than employment alone, it has been narrowly conceptualized, and, has received little to no attention outside of the employment context. In practice, the unemployment rate is a function of several neighborhood factors that reduce the likelihood that an individual will be able to secure and/or keep a job. As a result, neighborhoods with “plentiful and diverse job opportunities” may confer a number of micro- and macro- level advantages such as shorter commuting times, job proximity and accessibility, and access to prosocial networks (Coulton, 2003, Hillier, 2007). Broadly speaking, neighborhood features tend to explain the spatial distribution of labor market factors such as: the 1) characteristics of the area where workers live (e.g., race/ethnicity, mode of transportation, educational attainment, gender); 2) characteristics of the job (low-income job sector, distance from worker’s residence); and 3) characteristics of the area where workers are employed (Martín-Barroso et al., 2022).
